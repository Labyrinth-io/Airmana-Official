          AIRMANA PRIVACY POLICY
        </h1>

        <p>
          AIRMANA recognises the importance of protecting the privacy and the
          rights of individuals in relation to their personal information. This
          document is our privacy policy and it tells you how we collect and
          manage your personal information.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-white text-lg mt-10">
          What is your personal information?
        </h2>
        <p>
          When used in this privacy policy, the term “personal information” has
          the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act 1998 (Cth). In general terms,
          it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This
          may include your name, address, telephone number, email address and
          profession or occupation. If the information we collect personally
          identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the
          information will be considered personal information.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-white text-lg mt-10">
          What personal information do we collect and hold?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may collect your name, mailing or street address, email address,
          telephone number, facsimile number, age or birth date, profession,
          occupation or job title and any additional information relating to you
          that you provide to us directly through our websites or indirectly
          through use of our websites or online presence, through our
          representatives or otherwise and information you provide to us through
          our service centre, customer surveys or visits by our representatives
          from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also collect some information that is not personal information
          because it does not identify you or anyone else. For example, we may
          collect anonymous answers to surveys or aggregated information about
          how users use our website.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-white text-lg mt-10">
          How do we collect your personal information?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We collect your personal information directly from you unless it is
          unreasonable or impracticable to do so. When collecting personal
          information from you, we may collect in ways including:
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-white text-lg mt-10">Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          When you access our website, we may send a “cookie” (which is a small
          summary file containing a unique ID number) to your computer. This
          enables us to recognise your computer. It also enables us to keep track
          of your activity on our website for a period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which
          areas of our website have been visited and to measure transaction
          patterns in the aggregate. Our cookies do not collect personal
          information. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your
          browser so that your computer does not accept them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may log IP addresses (that is, the electronic addresses of computers
          connected to the internet) to analyse trends, administer the website
          and track users movements.
